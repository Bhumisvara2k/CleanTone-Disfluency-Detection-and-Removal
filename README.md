# CleanTone-Disfluency-Detection-and-Removal
"CleanTone" is a system designed to identify and eliminate speech disfluencies, such as silent pauses and filler words using advanced algorithms. It enhances the overall fluency and clarity of speech.

# Abstract
This project focuses on enhancing spoken communication by addressing interruptions and disruptions in speech, such as hesitations and moments of pause. The smoothness and coherence of speech are critical for effective communication, and thus, advanced technological solutions are employed to identify and rectify these disfluencies. During playback of audio recordings, strategic insertion of interrogative prompts fosters active 
engagement and comprehension among listeners. These strategically placed inquiries stimulate cognitive processing and encourage deeper engagement with the content.

In summary, our endeavour seeks to elevate the quality of spoken communication by employing advanced methodologies for disfluency detection and removal.

# Problem Statement
The frequent occurrence of disfluencies poses a significant challenge for effective communication processing. These interruptions disrupt the fluency, lead to the misinterpretation of the speaker’s intended message and degradation in overall audio quality. 
In such instances, there is a need for the detection and removal of these disfluencies in the recorded audio to enhance the overall speech quality and also analyzing the speaker’s delivery of speech for improving their communication skills.
