# CleanTone-Disfluency-Detection-and-Removal
"CleanTone" is a system designed to identify and eliminate speech disfluencies, such as silent pauses and filler words using advanced algorithms. It enhances the overall fluency and clarity of speech.

# Abstract

# Problem Statement
The frequent occurrence of disfluencies poses a significant challenge for effective communication processing. These interruptions disrupt the fluency, lead to the misinterpretation of the speaker’s intended message and degradation in overall audio quality. 
In such instances, there is a need for the detection and removal of these disfluencies in the recorded audio to enhance the overall speech quality and also analyzing the speaker’s delivery of speech for improving their communication skills.
